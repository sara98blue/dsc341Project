## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data-load}
##kidney <- read.csv("C:/Users/SaraE/Downloads/Chronic_Kidney_Disease/chronic_kidney_disease.arff", header=FALSE, comment.char = "@")

kidneys <- readARFF("C:/Users/SaraE/Downloads/Chronic_Kidney_Disease/chronic_kidney_disease.arff", data.reader = "readr", convert.to.logicals = TRUE)

kidneys
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r}
##plot(x = kidneys$sod, y = kidneys$pot)set.seed(341)
##data(kidneys)
kidneys <- as_tibble(kidneys)

x <- kidneys %>% dplyr::select(age, al, class)
x

k1 <- ggplot(x, aes(x = age, y = al, color = class)) + geom_jitter()

k1 + labs(title = "Age and Ablubin in patients with and with out chronic kidney disease", x ="patient age", y="albulim level")

```

```{r}
kidneys <- as_tibble(kidneys)

x2 <- kidneys %>% dplyr::select(sc, hemo, class)
x2

k2 <- ggplot(x2, aes(x = sc, y = hemo, color = class)) + geom_jitter()


k2 + labs(title = "sc and hem with and without chronic kidney disease", x ="Sreum Creatinine", y = "Hemoglobin")

```
```{r}
kidneys <- as_tibble(kidneys)

x3 <- kidneys %>% dplyr::select(appet, ane, class)
x3

k3 <- ggplot(x3, aes(x = appet, y = ane, color = class)) + geom_jitter()


k3 + labs(title = "Appeite and anemia with and without chronic kidney disease", x ="Appetite", y = "Anemia")

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
kidneys <- as_tibble(kidneys)

x4 <- kidneys %>% dplyr::select(dm, bgr, class)
x4

k4 <- ggplot(x4, aes(x = dm, y = bgr, fill = class)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")


k4 + labs(title = "Appeite and anemia with and without chronic kidney disease", x ="Diabetes", y = "Blood Glucose")
```
